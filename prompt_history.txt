Plan - 20260220
~
JL: Take a look at @README.md and @EMA.md to get a sense of what this project is about. We will then do some planning together. Specifically, we will need to chart how the project is to go. We need to design out the actual physical environment, likely as an indoor, workshop-cum-playground kind of environment that is open to foot traffic. For this physical environment, we also need its digital twin. Then the environment will also need to host different kinds of robots: legged robots like the ant, stationary but rotating robot like the "sound flower", robot dogs, robot on wheels and treads, humanoid robots, and event flying ones, such as a small drone or an even smaller dragonfly. We won't mind mingle in a few mobile robotic trashcans for example. And we may even do "bring-your-own-robot" days  in the kindergarten. The overarching goal should be clear: use the kindergarten to challenge research on continual learning for continual living (and creating!), to provide physical environments suitable for realizing the vision of the Alberta Plan while taking it to the task of working in the real world. But then we need to start small, starting with the simplest non-trivial setup. With these, please think about how we should proceed. Questions to propose and preliminarily answer include: which kinds of robots? which simulation environments? which variations? which combinations? which evaluations? which physical and virtual implementations to made available for the world through this open source project.
