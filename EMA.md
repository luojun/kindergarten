### EMA, or Embodied MuJoCo Ant

#### Desiderata:

1. It needs a life: wireless battery charge may be the right way to do it.
2. It needs torque control.
3. It needs an auto-curriculum environment: from a crib, to a play pen, to a play yard, to the whole kindergarten, nested.

#### Why life?

Basis for reward and for continuation: continual learning for continual living.

#### Why torque?

Sensorimotor abstraction towards geometry.

#### How auto-curriculum?

1. Wireless charging pad at bottom of crib.
2. Single step up and out of the crib into the play pen.
3. Terraced play pen upward into the play yard at the ground level of the kindergarten.
